        //Now, I have already completed the basics of stacks and queues in 12th, but I will still be going over them
        //in my notes here. This is because although I remeber most of what was taught, I don't think I have any
        //lasting notes or records of them. So, for future reference I will be making notes about them here, although
        //they may be a bit leaner than my notes for other structures.
